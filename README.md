Toll Management and Route Analysis for Fuel Transport Trucks
üìå Introduction
Efficient toll management is critical in the logistics sector, especially for fuel transport companies. Manual toll claims are often error-prone and susceptible to fraud, leading to increased costs and reduced transparency. This project automates toll cost calculations, ensuring accuracy and integrity in route and toll compliance.

üöÄ Features
Automated Toll Cost Calculation: Identifies toll plazas crossed and calculates accurate toll expenses.
Fraud Prevention: Ensures only legitimate toll claims are reimbursed.
GPS-Based Route Tracking: Monitors real-time vehicle movement and logs route details.
Interactive Map Visualization: Displays vehicle journeys, toll plazas crossed, and halt locations.
Data-Driven Insights: Generates reports for trip analysis and financial reconciliation.
üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Python (for data processing and mapping)
Libraries Used:
Folium: For interactive map generation
Geopy: For distance calculations
Pandas: For data handling and analysis
NumPy: For numerical computations
Data Storage: CSV files
üìä Dataset
Toll Data: Includes toll plaza locations, latitude/longitude, and charges.
Vehicle Tracking Data: Contains trip IDs, vehicle numbers, GPS coordinates, and timestamps.
üîßImplementation
The system follows a structured process to automate toll management and route analysis:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Preprocessing
Collects vehicle GPS tracking data and toll plaza locations.
Cleans and structures data for processing using Pandas.
Stores the data in CSV files for easy access.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Route Mapping & Toll Detection
Uses the Great Circle Distance algorithm to calculate the shortest distance between a vehicle‚Äôs GPS location and nearby toll plazas.
If a vehicle is within 1 km of a toll plaza, it is marked as a valid toll crossing.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Toll Cost Calculation
The system checks whether the trip is single or round based on toll crossings.
Computes total toll costs by summing up toll fees from the detected crossings.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Interactive Map Visualization
Uses Folium to generate an interactive map displaying:
The vehicle‚Äôs journey with start and end points.
Toll plazas crossed, marked for easy identification.
Stops or halts along the route.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Report Generation & Data Export
Generates CSV reports summarizing:
Toll crossings for each trip.
Total toll charges.
Route compliance status.
Saves interactive maps as HTML files for visualization.
